# Using-RSpec-to-Test-Projects

> In this project I used RSpec to create and run unit tests for previously completed projects in Ruby.

In this project I created a test example for my Enumerables Module, which I built in another project (project link is [here](https://github.com/StarSheriff2/Enumerables)). I used RSpec to build the unit tests for every method in the enumerable module, #each, #each_with_index, #select, #all?, #any?, #none?, #count, #map, and #inject.

## Built With

- Ruby
- Rspec gem
- VSCode

## Instructions

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. If you don't have git installed in your system, skip this step and go to step 3. If you do have git installed in your system, clone this repository to your computer in any directory you want by copying this text into your command prompt/terminal: `git clone https://github.com/StarSheriff2/Using-RSpec-to-Test-Projects.git`. Now go to step 6.
3. If you don't have git installed in your system, you can just download the game files. To do this, click on the green button that says "**Code**"
4. You will see a dropdown menu. Click on "**Download ZIP**".
5. Go to the directory where you downloaded the **ZIP file** and open it. Extract its contents to any directory you want in your system.
6. If you are not in your system terminal/command prompt already, please open it and go to the directory where you cloned the remote repository or extracted the game files.
7. While in the root directory, run the tests by typing the command `rspec spec/enumerables_spec.rb --format doc` to see test results.

## Live Example

- to run the tests in this live example, type this in the Shell: `rspec spec/enumerables_spec.rb --format doc`
